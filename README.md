## What is a lightning talk?

Think about your talk as a short pitch. It will be helpful to practice your talk beforehand! Keep it short, succinct and to the point.

For our purposes, a lightning talk is a talk lasting **no more than 5 minutes**.

You could prepare slides for your talk to help you explain.

**Time limits will be strictly enforced.**
